Create the perfect service menu and price list! Easily import, edit and style menus or other merchant price lists.




== Description ==

Now you can easily create, manage and distribute attractive and compelling service menus and price lists from one central dashboard!
The PriceCrossing service menu and price list plugin allows you to insert your service menus and price lists anywhere on your WordPress site with a simple short code [my menu].  It’s also a great tool to help promote your business on social media and local search sites; you can quickly and easily add your service menu or price list to any of your marketing activity on Facebook, Twitter, blog posts and more.
PriceCrossing takes PDFs, Word documents, or online URLs and turns them into professionally designed, reader-friendly service menus or price lists that can be easily edited and pushed out by our menu publishing service across the internet. Once you have created your service menu or price list on PriceCrossing, use this plugin to insert it anywhere you want, including your WordPress site or other sites, using the simple short code [my menu].
Anytime you update your service menu or price list on PriceCrossing, your information will automatically be synchronized and published on your WordPress site and on PriceCrossing’s distribution partner sites, including YP, Foursquare, and CitySearch, all sites where you used the plugin for marketing activities as well as many other local search destination sites. 



== How does it work?== 
Step 1: Claim your business page and create an account at PriceCrossing  Go to your business page on PriceCrossing.com and confirm that you are the owner of the business by creating a free account.  This will allow us to ensure that only owners and their staff have the right to post content to their business’ page.

Step 2: Prepare your service menu or price list  If your service menu or price list is already online, there’s a good chance that PriceCrossing already has it. If so, select from the drop down menu on the top right and select the “Update Menu” option.  If your service menu or price list is not already available on PriceCrossing, you can either type in the information manually or email us an existing file of your menu (PDF, Word, etc);  we will automatically convert it to an online version within 48 hours.

Step 3: Edit your service menu or price list Once your service menu or price list has been claimed or created in PriceCrossing, use our very friendly menu editor to make any required changes. When you’ve finalized everything, click on the “Save Changes” button in the top-right corner of the page.

Step 4: Retrieve the HTML snippet on PriceCrossing to display your service menu or price list on your WordPress site  Click on the “Publish” button in the right-side  of the Update Services page. Copy the HTML snippet that displays in the pop-up window.

Step 5: Use the PriceCrossing wordpress plugin to generate the [my menu] shortcode Paste the HTML snippet generated in Step 4 in the text area of the plugin and click the "Save" button.

Step 6: Use the [my menu] shortcode You’re now ready to use the [my menu] shortcode to insert your service menu or price list anywhere in your WordPress site as well as any other site where you can insert content!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why is it important to publish my service menus or price list on my website?
Research shows that 95% of people use the internet to search for services and prices, like Manicures and Pedicures, or auto repair in Houston, and not usually for businesses name, like Stacy Hair Salon.  So it’s very important to have this information not only on your website but throughout the major social networks,  review sites and Yellow Pages directories,,,all the places where people search.

How quickly will my service menu or price list be updated on my site and on PriceCrossing partner sites? 
When you update a service menu or price list, the information is pushed out to the internet immediately.  All sites are updated within minutes.

I would like to create a menu to see how it looks before claiming my business page.  Can I do this?
Sure.  Go to pricecrossing.com (http://www.pricecrossing.com) to create a free account and use a fictitious name for a business to test out PriceCrossing.

Where do I get the PriceCrossing HTML snippet for this plugin? 
Once you have created your PriceCrossing account, edited or created your service menu or price list for your business, click on the Publish tab on the left-hand side of your dashboard. Then, click the “Install on My Website” button to get the HTML snippet. All you need to do is paste the code snippet into the plugin's text area.

Does PriceCrossing already have a copy of my service menu or price list?
If a merchant already has its service menu or price list available online, there’s a good chance that we already have it on PriceCrossing. To retrieve the menu, simply create an account and enter the name of your business. If your service menu or price list is not yet available on PriceCrossing, you can upload it as a PDF or Word document or manually enter items and PriceCrossing will create a service menu or price list for you.

How does PriceCrossing’s publish feature work beyond my WordPress site? 
If you manage your service menu or price list using PriceCrossing, we will publish all of your information, every time it is updated, to PriceCrossing’s partner distribution sites, like YP, Foursquare, CitySearch as well as many other local search destination sites.
